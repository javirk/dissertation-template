\section{Section1}\label{sec:data_challenges}\sidecitationnonum{sutton2019bitter}{Breakthrough progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling computation by search and learning. The eventual success is tinged with bitterness, and often incompletely digested, because it is success over a favored, human-centric approach.}
